*** OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING ***

In OOP, objects and classes are used to organize code to describe things and what they can do

Create a basic javascript object:
  let dog = {
    name: "doggie",
    numLegs: 4
  };
  
Use dot notation to access the properties of an object:
  console.log(dog.name);
  
Create a method on an object:
  objects can have a special type of property, called a method
  method are properties that are functions
  let dog = {
    name: "doggie",
    sayName: function(){return "woof woof "+dog.name;}
  };

Make code more reusable with the this keyword:
