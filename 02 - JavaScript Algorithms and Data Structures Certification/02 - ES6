*** ES6 ***

Explore differences between the var and let keywords:
  unlike var, when using let, a variable with the same name can only be declared once
  let varName = "cat";
  let varName = "dog";      // returns an error
  
Compare scopes of the var and let keywords:
  a var keyword is declared globally or locally if declared in a function
  if you declare a variable with the let keyword inside a block, statement or expression, its scope is limited to it
  
Declare a read-only variable with the const keyword:
  const has all the features of let + it is in read-only
  once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned
  a common practice when declaring a constant variable is to use all uppercase letters
  
Mutate an array declared with const:
  objects to a variable using const are still mutable
  it only prevents reassignment of the variable identifier
  const array = [ 1, 2, 3 ];
  array = [ 1, 3, 3 ];          // returns an error
  array[1]=3;                   // does not return an error
  
Prevent object mutation:
  Object.freeze(object);
  you can no longer add, update or delete properties

Use arrow functions to write concise anonymous functions:
