*** FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING ***

In functional programming, code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs

Learn about functional programming:
  isolated functions: no dependance of the state of the program
  pure functions: same input always gives the same output
  functions with limited side effects
  
Understand functional programming terminology:
  callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function
  unctions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function, are called first class functions
  the functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called higher order functions
  when the functions are passed in to another function or returned from another function, then those functions which gets passed in or returned can be called a lambda
