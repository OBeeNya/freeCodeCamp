*** FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING ***

In functional programming, code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs

Learn about functional programming:
  isolated functions: no dependance of the state of the program
  pure functions: same input always gives the same output
  functions with limited side effects
