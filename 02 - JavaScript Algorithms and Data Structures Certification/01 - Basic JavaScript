*** BASIC JAVASCRIPT ***

Comment JavaScript code:
  // commenting on one line
  /* */ multi-line commenting
  
Declaring variables:
  var nameOfVariable ;
  
Storing value with the assignment operator:
  varName = x ;
    
Assigning the value of one variable to another:
  varName1 = VarName2 ;
  
Initializing variables with the assignment operator:
  var varName = x ;
  
Uninitialiazed variables:
  initial value is undefined
  mathematical operation on undefined variable results in NaN (Not a Number)
  
Case sensitivity in variables:
  var someVar != var SomeVar
  best practice: first word in lowercase then uppercase for first letter of following words: someVarName
  
Add two numbers with javascript:
  var varName = x + y;
  
Substract one number from another with javascript:
  var varName = x - y ;
  
Multiply two numbers with javascript:
  var varName = x * y ;
  
Divide one number by another with javacsript:
  var varName = x / y ;
  
Increment a number with javascript:
  varName++;
  
Decrement a number with javascript:
  varName--;
  
Create decimal numbers (floats) with javascript:
  var varName = x.y ;
  
Multiply two decimals with javascript:
  var varName = w.x * y.z ;
  
Divide one decimal by another with javascript:
  var varName = w.x / y.z ;
  
Findind a remainder with javascript:
  var varName = x % y ;
  
Compound assignments with augmented addition:
  varName += x ;
  
Compound assignments with augmented substraction:
  varName -= x;
  
Compound assignements with augmented multiplication:
  varName *= x;
  
Compound assignments with augmented division:
  varName /= x ;
  
Declare string variables:
  var varName = "string" ;
  
Escaping literal quotes in strings:
  type \" instead of just "
  
Quoting strings with single quotes:
  string values may be written with single or double quotes
  you might want to use one type of quote over the other if you want to use both in an string
  
Escape sequences in strings:
  \' single quote
  \" double quote
  \\ backlash
  \n newline
  \r carriage return
  \t tab
  \b word boundary
  \f form feed
  
Concatenating strings with plus operator:
  "string 1 " + "string 2" = "string 1 string 2"
  
Concatenating strings with the plus equals operator:
  var varName = "string1" ;
  varName += "string2" ;
  
Constructing strings with variables:
  var varName1 = "string1" + varName2 + "string2" ;
  
Appending variables to strings:
  var varName1 = "string1" ;
  var varName2 = "string2" ;
  varName2 += varName1 ;
  
Find the length of a string:
  varName = "string".length ;
  
Use bracket notation to find the first character in a string:
  var firstLetter = varWord[0] ;
  
Understand string immutability:
  it's not possible to change one letter from a string as such varWord[0]="x" ;

Use bracket notation to find the Nth character in a string:
