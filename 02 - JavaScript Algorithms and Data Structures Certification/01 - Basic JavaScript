*** BASIC JAVASCRIPT ***

Comment JavaScript code:
  // commenting on one line
  /* */ multi-line commenting
  
Declaring variables:
  var nameOfVariable ;
  
Storing value with the assignment operator:
  varName = x ;
    
Assigning the value of one variable to another:
  varName1 = VarName2 ;
  
Initializing variables with the assignment operator:
  var varName = x ;
  
Uninitialiazed variables:
  initial value is undefined
  mathematical operation on undefined variable results in NaN (Not a Number)
  
Case sensitivity in variables:
  var someVar != var SomeVar
  best practice: first word in lowercase then uppercase for first letter of following words: someVarName
  
Add two numbers with javascript:
  var varName = x + y;
  
Substract one number from another with javascript:
  var varName = x - y ;
  
Multiply two numbers with javascript:
  var varName = x * y ;
  
Divide one number by another with javacsript:
  var varName = x / y ;
  
Increment a number with javascript:
  varName++;
  
Decrement a number with javascript:
  varName--;
  
Create decimal numbers (floats) with javascript:
  var varName = x.y ;
  
Multiply two decimals with javascript:
  var varName = w.x * y.z ;
  
Divide one decimal by another with javascript:
  var varName = w.x / y.z ;
  
Findind a remainder with javascript:
  var varName = x % y ;
  
Compound assignments with augmented addition:
  varName += x ;
  
Compound assignments with augmented substraction:
  varName -= x;
  
Compound assignements with augmented multiplication:
  varName *= x;
