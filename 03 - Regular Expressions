*** REGULAR EXPRESSIONS ***

Using the test method:
  regular expressions (regex) are used to match parts of strings
  let string = "freecodecamp";
  let regexg = /code/;
  /regex/.test('string');      // true
  
Match literal strings:
  the previous method will only search for a literal match, meaning case sensitive
  
Match a literal string with different possibilities:
  you can search for multiple patterns using the alternation or OR operator |
  /regex1|regex2|regex3/
  
Ignore case while matching:
  you can match both cases using what is called a flag
  the flag that ignores the case is the i flag
  /regex/i
  
Extract matches:
  'string'.match(/regex/);     // returns regex if found
  
Find more than the fist match:
  use the g flag
  let regex = /word/g;
  string.match(regex);      // returns all occurence of regex
  
Match anything with wildcard period:
  the wildcard character . will match with any one character
  let regex = /w.rd/;
  
Macth single character with multiple possibilities:
  you can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility with character classes
  let regex = /w[aio]rd/;
  
Match letters of the alphabet:
  inside a character set, you can define a range of characters to match using a -
  let regex = /w[a-e]rd/;
  
Match numbers and letters of the alphabet:
  using a - to match a range of characters is not limited to letters
  let regex = /[a-z0-9]/;
  
Match single characters not specified:
  you can also create a set of characters that you do not want to match
  these character sets are called negated character set
  /[^aeiou]/
  
Match characters that occur one or more times:
  if you wan to match a character that apepars once or more consecutively
  /a+/
  
Match characters that occur zero or more times:
  /go*/
  
Find characters with lazy matching:
  regex are by default greedy and will look for the largest sub-string that fits the pattern
  you can use ? to change it to lazy matching
  /t[a-z]*i/    // returns titani in titanic 
  /t[a-z]*?i/   // returns ti in titanic
  
Mtach beginning string patterns:
  ^ used outside of a chracter set is used to search for a pattern at the beginning of strings
  /^word/
  
Match ending string patterns:
  $ is used to search for a pattern at the end of strings
  /word$/
