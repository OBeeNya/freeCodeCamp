*** RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN PRINCIPLES ***

Media queries:
  @media ( condition ) {
    CSS rules;
  }
  
Responsive images:
  img {
    max-width: 100%;              // image never wider than the container it is in
    height: auto;                 // image keeps its original ratio
  }
  
Higher resolution display:
  different devices have different pixel density (Pixel Per Inch - PPI or Dots Per Inch DPI)
  simple way to make an image properly appear on a high resolution device is to reduce its size

Responsive typography:
  instead of using em or px, we can use viewport units and percentages
  viewports units are relative to the viewport dimensions of a device
  percentages are relative to the size of the parent container element
  vw: viewport width
  vh: viewport height
  vmin: viewport's smaller dimension
  vmax: viewport's bigger dimension
