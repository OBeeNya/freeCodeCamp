*** CSS FLEXBOX ***

Placing the following CSS property on an element allows to use other flex properties to build a responsive page:
  display: flex;
  
Flex-direction property:
  align any children of an element into rows and columns
  row / row-reverse / column / column-reverse
  
Justify-content property:
  main axis: direction the flex items are arranged in, horizontal line for rows, vertical line for columns, goes from main start to main end
  cross axis: perpendicular to the main axis, vertical for rows, horizontal for columns, goes from cross start to cross end
  flex-start: align items to the start of the main axis
  flex-end: align items to the end of the main axis
  space-between: align items to the center of the main axis, with extra space placed between the items, first and last items are pushed to the edge of the container
  space-around: align items to the center of the main axis but first and last items are not locked to the edges
  space-evenly: distributes space evenly between the flex items with a full space at either end of the flex container

Align-item property:
  aligns flex items along the cross axis
  flex-start, flex-end, center
  stretch: stretch the items to fill the container (default value)
  baseline: aligns items to the baseline, line that the letters sit on
  
Flex-wrap property:
  extra items move into a new row/column
  nowrap: default setting
  wrap / wrap-reverse
  
Flex-shrink property:
  allows an item to shrink if the flex container is too small
  takes numbers as values, the higher the more it shrinks
  
Flex-grow property:
  controls the size of items when the parent container expands
  takes numbers as values, the higher the more it grows
  
Flex-basis property:
  specifies the initial size of items before adjustments with flex-shrink and flex-grow
  uses regular units like px, em, % etc.
  auto sizes items based on content
  
Flex shorthand property:
  shortcut available to set several flex properties at once
  flex: flex-grow flex-shrink flex-basis;
  
Order property:
  tells CSS the order of how flex items appear in the flex container (order on main axis)
  takes numbers as values, negative values can be used
  
Align-self property:
  allows to adjust each item's alignment individually
  other common adjustment techniques such as float, clear and vertical-align do not work on flex items
  takes the same values as align-items and override any value brought by align-items
