*** APPLIED ACCESSIBILITY ***

Use of headings:
  headers should have semantic meaning
  headers with equal rank implies new sections, lower ranks implies sub-sections
  each page should only have one h1 header

Use of main:
  only one per page
  used to wrap the main content
  surround the information related to the entral topic of your page
  
Use of article:
  used to wrap independant, self-contained content
  the section element can be used within it and is used for grouping thematically related content
  
Use of header:
  used to wrap introductory information or navigation links
  works well for content that is repeated on multiple pages
  is meant to be used on the body element, is different from the head element which contains the page's title and meta information
  
Use of nav:
  meant to wrap around the main navigation links of your page
  
Use of footer:
  primarily used to contain copyright information or links to related documents
  
Use of audio element:
  <audio id="*" controls>                 // controls attribute adds play, pause and other default controls
    <source src="url" type="*" />         // type can usually be audio/mpeg
  </audio>
  
Use of figure:
  <figure>
    <img...>
    <figcaption>
      Briefly notes the trends or conclusion brought by the figure
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
  
Label element:
  wraps the text for a specific form control item
  <form>
    <label for="*">name of label</label>          // for attribute should be the same as the id attribute of the input
    <input type="*" id="*" name="*">
  </form>
  
Fieldset element:
  wrap radio buttons to show they are part of a set
  <form>
    <fieldset>
      <input...>
      <label...>
      <input>
      <label>
     </fieldset>
   </form>

Date form attribute:
  <input type="date" id="*" name="*">
  
Datetime attribute:
  <time datetime="year-month-day">text of date</time>
  
Elements only visible to screen readers:
  all previous accessibility points only used HTML5
  CSS can also be used to improve accessibility
  you can for example position elements off the visual area of the browser window:
    .SR-only {
      position: absolute;
      left: -10000px;
      width: 1px;                 // if you put 0px, the element will be hidden even for screen readers
      height: 1px;
      top: auto;
      overflow: hidden;
    }
  display: none; and visibility: hidden; hide the content for everyone, including screen readers
  
High contrast:
  sufficient contrast improves the readability of the content
  recommandation: at least 4.5 to 1
  1:1 = same color
  21:1 = black on white
  
Colorblindness:
  most common form is a reduced sensitivity to detect greens
  
Using descriptive link text:
  don't have links showing "click here" or "read more"
  the link should describe informatiom from the link
  
Access keys:
  the accesskey attribute specifies a shortcut key to activate or bring focus to an element
  particularly useful when used with interactive elements such as links, buttons and forms
  example:
    <button accesskey="b">Button</button>
    
Tabindex:
  the tabindex attributes indicates that an element can be focused on, and its value (0, negative or positive) determines its behavior
  <main tabindex="0"> </main>
  tabindex first goes to 1, 2, 3 etc. then to the elements at 0
  -1 is not reachable by the keyboard, generally used to bring focus to an element programmatically
  can be used in combination with the pseudo-class :focus to determine how an element looks once focused
