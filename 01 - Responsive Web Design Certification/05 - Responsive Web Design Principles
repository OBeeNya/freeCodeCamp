*** RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN PRINCIPLES ***

Media queries:
  @media ( condition ) {
    CSS rules;
  }
  
Responsive images:
  img {
    max-width: 100%;              // image never wider than the container it is in
    height: auto;                 // image keeps its original ratio
  }
  
Higher resolution display:
  different devices have different pixel density (Pixel Per Inch - PPI or Dots Per Inch DPI)
  simple way to make an image properly appear on a high resolution device is to reduce its size
